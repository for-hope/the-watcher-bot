# Overview
[Homepage](https://www.thewatcher.xyz/)
> Note: The Watcher Bot is still in alpha and more developement is needed for a stable version.

The Watcher bot enables discord users to chat between servers using shared channels without joining all of them. An admin can create a shared channel and invite multipule servers, these servers
will be linked by a shared channel where any message sent by users is deleted and resent by the bot to all the linked servers. The bot also has moderation tools to 
control servers and users in these shared channels. This is a self-hosted bot, you can either contribute to the bot's developement here or fork your own branch and
maintain your own instance.
